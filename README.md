# Readify

By using our web application ‘Readify’, users can search and read books in PDF version according to the desired themes/categories for free and just by a simple click.

## Problem :
Nothing like a good book to escape from everyday life and let your mind wander. Nowadays all people want to use digital books than paper books.
Due to the technological revolution everything has become computerized, but despite this there are problems and difficulties in finding PDF version books available in a single platform for free.

### Database
After doing a good search, we found our database on which we will base our project using the ‘Google Books’ API.
Google Books is on a mission to digitize the world's book content and make it more accessible on the web. The Books API is a way to search and access this content, as well as create and display personalization around this content.

## The conception and structure of the application
###class diagram
A main step in developing the project is to model a class diagram by defining the necessary tables, attributes and relationships.

### The use case diagram

An important step to develop the project, is to model the use case diagram because it helps us to know the behavior of a system and allows to capture the system requirements. This diagram also identifies the interactions between the system and its actors.
The main actor of our web application is:
 The general user who uses the application to connect to our platform from where he can search and read books and even evaluate or comment on them.
In the project directory, you can run:

## Interfaces

Our application is made up of 8 interfaces:

## Methodology and development process
We have chosen as the process of development of our software Iterative model.
 The iterative model is in the form of a set of successive iterations where each iteration is a short-lived (about 2 weeks) cascading model.
 The result of an iteration is a complete version of the software that is not fully refined and thorough (possibly a disposable prototype) useful for customer validation.

## Conclusion
The Readify Project is the only online bookstore that offers PDF version books with a recommendation system thanks to the Google books API.
